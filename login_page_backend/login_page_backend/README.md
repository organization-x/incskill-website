## Tech Stack
We will be using Amazon web services to deploy and host our project. We’re using Django for Python as our backend framework. We chose this instead of JS because our engineers are more familiar with Python than JS. For the frontend, we’re using Bootstrap.
## Project Status
The website is still in development, however, the website is now mildly accessible to users. Currently we have a login, signup, and courses page established and a Navigation Bar to go between these pages. Within the next few weeks, more features will be rolled out, including styling, screenreader compatibility, and progress bars for users. 
## Launch
Currently, there are several ways to open the website, the first, and primary method for accessing the site should be by opening a live server from loginPage.html or starting it through the terminal with the command 'start loginPage.html'.
