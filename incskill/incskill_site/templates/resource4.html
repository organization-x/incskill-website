  <p>
    In this resource, you will learn about the following.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>

  <h3 id="sec-h3">Loops</h3>
  <p>
    One of the key concepts in programming is loops. Loops allow us to have the
    computer take an action repeatedly either for a specific number of times or
    until a particular condition holds. Based on how we want the computer to
    take actions, there are two kinds of loops-for loop or wile loop. We will
    discuss each of these now.
  </p>
</div>

<div  class="sec" id="sec">
  <h3>For Loop</h3>
  <p>
    For loop executes a particular action a certain number of times. Here is
    how it works.
  </p>
  <p>
    for i in range(No. of times you want to run the code):
  </p>
  <p>
    &lt;Do this&gt;
  </p>
  <p>
    Just like the "if" condition, what we want the computer to perform
    repeatedly is included within the "for" block. As you may remember from the
    last resource, whenever this happens, we use indentation. Therefore,
    everything within the "for" block should be indented. In the above example,
    for instance, &lt;do this&gt; has been indented using four spaces.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here is an example of printing the first ten numbers.
  </p>
  <p>
    for i in range(10):
  </p>
  <p>
    print(i)
  </p>
  <p>
    This will give the following output.
  </p>
  <p>
    0
  </p>
  <p>
    1
  </p>
  <p>
    2
  </p>
  <p>
    3
  </p>
  <p>
    4
  </p>
  <p>
    5
  </p>
  <p>
    6
  </p>
  <p>
    7
  </p>
  <p>
    8
  </p>
  <p>
    9
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, you may be surprised to see why it printed 0. This is because in
    programming, values are zero-indexed. In other words, computers start
    counters from 0. So, to print the first ten numbers, you can do the
    following.
  </p>
  <p>
    for i in range(10):
  </p>
  <p>
    print(i+1)
  </p>
  <p>
    There is another way to do this as well.
  </p>
  <p>
    for i in range(1, 11):
  </p>
  <p>
    print(i)
  </p>
  <p>
    This will give the same output. Here, we passed two values to the "range"
    function in the "for" loop. The first value was the initializing value,
    i.e. we wanted the computer to start counting from 1, not its default 0.
    Second, we specified until what value of i should the computer execute the
    code. Now, because we wanted to execute 10 times with the value of i
    starting from 1, we specified that the computer should execute until the
    value of i is 11 at which point it should break. Remember that by default,
    the value of i increases by 1 every time the loop is run.
   </p>
  <p>
    Next, what if we wanted to print the first ten even numbers exclusive of 0?
    We could do something like this.
  </p>
  <p>
    for i in range(1, 11):
  </p>
  <p>
    print(i*2)
  </p>
  <p>
    Output:
  </p>
  <p>
    2
  </p>
  <p>
    4
  </p>
  <p>
    6
  </p>
  <p>
    8
  </p>
  <p>
    10
  </p>
  <p>
    12
  </p>
  <p>
    14
  </p>
  <p>
    16
  </p>
  <p>
    18
  </p>
  <p>
    20
  </p>
  <p>
    There is yet another way to do this. What if we wanted to tell the computer
    that start with the value of i as 2, go until the value of i is 22, but
    each time instead of increasing the value of i by 1 as you normally do,
    increase by 2. What do you think will happen? Try out this code.
  </p>
  <p>
    for i in range(2, 22, 2):
  </p>
  <p>
    print(i)
  </p>
  <p>
    This will give you the exact same value. The third parameter in this
    function specifies how much the value of i should increase each time the
    code runs.
  </p>
  <p>
    What if we want to print these in the reverse order?
  </p>
  <p>
    for i in range(20, 0, -2):
  </p>
  <p>
    print(i)
  </p>
  <p>
    Here, we initialize the value of i as 20, we want it to execute the program
    until the value of i reaches 0 (at which point it should stop), but each
    time, the value of i should increase by -2 or decrease by 2.
  </p>
  <p>
    In summary, the "for" loop can take three values-the initialization value,
    the value until which the code should be executed and the amount by which
    the value should increase (or decrease as denoted by a negative sign). Only
    the second parameter is mandatory which is why we can have a completely
    valid for loop with just one and as many as three parameters.
  </p>
</div>

<div  class="sec" id="sec">
  <h3>While Loop</h3>
  <p>
    What if you wanted to execute an action repeatedly until a certain
    condition was true? Let's imagine that you want to multiply 1 by 2, and
    then multiply the resultant repeatedly by 2 so long as the value is less
    than 50. This is where you would use the while loop. Here is the syntax
    (i.e. how it works).
  </p>
  <p>
    while &lt;condition&gt;:
  </p>
  <p>
    &lt;Do this&gt;
  </p>
  <p>
    Note the block within the “while” loop is indented.
  </p>
  <p>
    So, the above code will be written as:
  </p>
  <p>
    i = 1 #Initializing i to be 1
  </p>
  <p>
    while i &lt; 50: #This is the condition of the while loop
  </p>
  <p>
    i = i*2
  </p>
  <p>
    print(i)
  </p>
  <p>
    Output:
  </p>
  <p>
    2
  </p>
  <p>
    4
  </p>
  <p>
    8
  </p>
  <p>
    16
  </p>
  <p>
    32
  </p>
  <p>
    64
  </p>
  <p>
    Here is what happened.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      i was first initialized to 1
    </li>
    <li>
      The while loop condition was set as i &lt; 50. This means that every
      time, at this step, the computer will check the value of i and only if
      it is less than 50 will it go to the block within the "while" loop.
    </li>
    <li>
      Within the block, we multiply the current value of i with 2, assign it
      back to i (i.e. essentially update it), and then print it.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    You will notice that the last number in the output is 64. This is because
    when the value of i was 32, it went into the loop (since 32 &lt; 64), got
    multiplied by 2 (i.e. became 64) and 64 was printed. But as the next step,
    it came back to the while condition; the computer checked if the current
    value of i (which is now 64) is less than 50 and of course it isn't. Hence,
    the loop stopped.
  </p>
  </div>

<div  class="sec" id="sec">
  <h3>Break Statement</h3>
  <p>
    Now let's combine "if" condition with loops. What if you wanted to
    terminate a loop based on a condition which is in addition to what may be
    specified already in a while loop. This is where the break statement comes
    handy.
  </p>
  <p>
Let's say you want to implement the same exercise as above, i.e.
multiplying 1 by 2 and then the resulting number by 2 until it is less than
50. Now, what if you want to stop this process as soon as the value of i×2
is 32. Notice that there are two conditions here. To do so, the above code
will be adapted as follows.
  </p>
  <p>
    i = 1 #Initializing i to be 1
  </p>
  <p>
    while i &lt; 50: #This is the condition of the while loop
  </p>
  <p>
    i = i*2 # value multiplied by 2
  </p>
  <p>
    if i == 32: # The second condition
  </p>
  <p>
    break # If the above second condition is true, break out of the
    loop
  </p>
  <p>
    print(i)
  </p>
  <p>
    Output:
  </p>
  <p>
    2
  </p>
  <p>
    4
  </p>
  <p>
    8
  </p>
  <p>
    16
  </p>
  <p>
    Here is what happened.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      i was first initialized to 1
    </li>
    <li>
      The while loop condition was set as i &lt; 50. This means that every
      time, at this step, the computer will check the value of i and only if
      it is less than 50 will it go to the block within the "while" loop.
    </li>
    <li>
      Within the block, we multiply the current value of i with 2, assign it
      back to i (i.e. essentially update it). Then, we check if the current
      value of i (i.e. the value that was just multiplied by 2) is 32. If
      yes, we break out. Otherwise, we print the value of i and then go back
      to the top of the loop where the first loop condition (i.e. i&lt;50) is
      checked again.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Here, when the value of i was 16, there was a check to see if it is less
    than 50. Since it is, the control passed into the loop where i was
    multiplied by 2 to yield 32. Then, an "if" condition checked if the value
    was 32, which being true, resulted in a break out of the loop and hence the
    output stopped there and then.
  </p>
  <p>
    Similar "break" statement can be used with for loop as well.
